# Hearing Test

This is an implementation of digit-triplet test [1].
It estimated a SNR level that the user in current environmental setting can recognize three spoken digits in present of background noise.
Subject should listent to several audio clips and each time type in which number is spoken. To estimnate the 
It is an implementation of the Adaptive Staircase Psychoacoustics method (3AFC, 2 down- 1 up) as proposed by Levit [2].

## Setup

Currently numbers for English and German languages are provided. 
Audio clips are stored in `\assets\[lang]_num_snr` where `[lang]` can be `en` or `de`.
You can change the language and others settings by editing the config object in the `\assets\js\hearing_test.js`.


## Results
It should be used by your target group in a laboratory settings to find out what is a good SNR level (as cutting point
 for  recognizing normal hearing participants) to be included in your crowdsourcing test. 
Result shows the SNR level that the subject can successfully recognize the three spoken digits in presence of background noise and in 
70.7% (or more) of times.
